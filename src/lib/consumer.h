/**
 * Contextual information can be, from the user's point of view, divided
 * into three aspects - "who am I?", "where am I?" (what are my surroundings?)
 * and "what am I doing?".
 *
 * Activities deal with the last one - "what am I doing?". The current activity
 * refers to what the user is doing at the moment, while the other activities
 * represent things that he/she was doing before, and probably will be doing
 * again.
 *
 * Activity is an abstract concept whose meaning can differ from one user to
 * another. Typical examples of activities are "developing a KDE project",
 * "studying the 19th century art", "composing music", "lazing on a Sunday
 * afternoon" etc.
 *
 * Consumer provides read-only information about activities.
 *
 * Before relying on the values retrieved by the class, make sure that the
 * serviceStatus is set to Running. Otherwise, you can get invalid data either
 * because the service is not functioning properly (or at all) or because
 * the class did not have enough time to synchronize the data with it.
 *
 * For example, if this is the only existing instance of the Consumer class,
 * the listActivities method will return an empty list.
 *
 * @code
 * void someMethod() {
 *     // Do not copy. This approach is not a good one!
 *     Consumer c;
 *     doSomethingWith(c.listActivities());
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Instances of the Consumer class should be long-lived. For example, members
 * of the classes that use them, and you should listen for the changes in the
 * provided properties.
 *
 * @since 4.5
