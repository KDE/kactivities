src/imports/resourcemodel.cpp:106:
 NOTE: What to do if the file does not exist?
       Ignoring that case since the daemon creates it on startup.
       Is it plausible that somebody will instantiate the ResourceModel
       before the daemon is started?

       for application:/ and a few more
src/imports/resourcemodel.cpp:554:
 TODO: This might be smarter possibly, but might collide
       with the SQL model. Implement a custom model with internal
       cache instead of basing it on QSqlModel.

 TODO: We need to group by and sum scores at some point.
       This is a minor use-case, but someone might want to
       have lists for two agents merged into one or
       something similar. This applies to other queries
       as well.
