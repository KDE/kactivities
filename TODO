 NOTE: What to do if the file does not exist?
       Ignoring that case since the daemon creates it on startup.
       Is it plausible that somebody will instantiate the ResourceModel
       before the daemon is started?

 TODO: Database connection naming could be smarter (thread-id-based,
       reusing connections...?)

 TODO: Will probably need some more special handling -
       for application:/ and a few more
src/imports/resourcemodel.cpp:551:
 TODO: This might be smarter possibly, but might collide
       with the SQL model. Implement a custom model with internal
       cache instead of basing it on QSqlModel.

 TODO: Since plasma is now dealing with activity model wallpapers,
       replace ActivityModel with the KActivities::ActivitiesModel
       (but keep the name)
